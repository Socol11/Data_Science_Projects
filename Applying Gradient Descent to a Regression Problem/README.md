# Applying Gradient Descent to a Regression Problem

Let's try to use gradient descent to solve a real-life linear regression problem. Our goal will be to build a simple linear regression model to predict the sales of some product based on the amount of money spent on advertising.

Build a model with three predictors.

Initially take all weights equal to 0, set the learning rate as 0.00005 and train the model for 500000 iterations.

Get the resulting weights for the three predictors.
